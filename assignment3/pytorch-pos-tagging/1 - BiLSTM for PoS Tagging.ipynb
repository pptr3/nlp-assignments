    "# Assignment 3 : Sequence labelling with RNNs\n",
    "In this assignement we will ask you to perform POS tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to follow these steps:\n",
    "*   Download the corpora and split it in training and test sets, structuring a dataframe.\n",
    "*   Embed the words using GloVe embeddings\n",
    "*   Create a baseline model, using a simple neural architecture\n",
    "*   Experiment doing small modifications to the model\n",
    "*   Evaluate your best model\n",
    "*   Analyze the errors of your model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corpora**:\n",
    "Ignore the numeric value in the third column, use only the words/symbols and its label.\n",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nltk/nltk_data/gh-pages/packages/corpora/dependency_treebank.zip \n",
    "\n",
    "**Splits**: documents 1-100 are the train set, 101-150 validation set, 151-199 test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline**: two layers architecture: a Bidirectional LSTM and a Dense/Fully-Connected layer on top.\n",
    "**Modifications**: experiment using a GRU instead of the LSTM, adding an additional LSTM layer, and using a CRF in addition to the LSTM. Each of this change must be done by itself (don't mix these modifications).<br>\n",
    "1) BiLSTM +  FC <br>\n",
    "2) BiGRU + FC <br>\n",
    "3) BiLSTMx2 + FC <br>\n",
    "4) BiLSTM +  FC + CRF <br>\n",
    "**Training and Experiments**: all the experiments must involve only the training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation**: in the end, only the best model of your choice must be evaluated on the test set. The main metric must be F1-Macro computed between the various part of speech (without considering punctuation classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Analysis** (optional) : analyze the errors done by your model, try to understand which may be the causes and think about how to improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Report**: You are asked to deliver a small report of about 4-5 lines in the .txt file that sums up your findings."
