    "This assignment is centred on a particular and emerging NLP task, formally known as **fact checking** (or fake checking). As AI techniques become more and more powerful, reaching amazing results, such as image and text generation, it is more than ever necessary to build tools able to distinguish what is real from what is fake.\n",

    "The dataset is about facts taken from Wikipedia documents that have to be verified. In particular, facts could face manual modifications in order to define fake information or to give different formulations of the same concept.\n",

    "The dataset consists of 185,445 claims manually verified against the introductory sections of Wikipedia pages and classified as ```Supported```, ```Refuted``` or ```NotEnoughInfo```.

    "    \n",
    "*    **Evidence**: a nested list of document IDs along with the sentence ID that is associated to the fact to verify. In particular, each list element is a tuple of four elements: the first two are internal annotator IDs that can be safely ignored; the third term is the document ID (called URL) and the last one is the sentence number (ID) in the pointed document to consider.\n",
